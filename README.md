# DIP-Project

The project does not provide completely correct results but it works properly with detecting bad data in an image. Also around 70% of the results with Hough Transform is correct.

To run this code successfully you need to have several libraries installed and a specific directory structure for the input data files. Here's a list of the requirements:

_The commands that follow are for Windows_

-tensorFlow for building the neural network model: pip install tensorflow
-scikit-learn for various machine learning functionalities: pip install scikit-learn
-imbalanced-learn for handling imbalanced datasets: pip install imbalanced-learn
-scikit-image for image processing: pip install scikit-image
-opencv-python for image manipulation and processing: pip install opencv-python
-matplotlib for plotting and visualization: pip install matplotlib
-numpy for numerical computations: pip install numpy
-xmltodict for parsing XML files: pip install xmltodict
